# What to do next
1. Make roll/pitch/yaw consecutive. Solve +pi->-pi and -pi->+pi.
2. Re-calibrition after a certain length of time.
  2.1 Add three new variables to record the roll/pitch/yaw of stationary status.
  2.2 Use the relative roll/pitch/yaw for pattern recognition.
  2.3 Use an array to record the roll/pitch/yaw history. If there is just small vibration, reset the roll/pitch/yaw of stationary status.
  
# DDL
1. Jun 3. Demo for rep count.

#TODO
1. Get the base value.
2. pattern recognition.
3. roll
